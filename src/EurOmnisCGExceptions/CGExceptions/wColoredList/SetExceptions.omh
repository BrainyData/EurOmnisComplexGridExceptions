;  the complex-grid row section contains a single entry field that
;  displays the contents of the text list column
;  we set the background of each row according to the value of iList.Value
;  we do this by changing the exception $forecolor of the entry field
Do iList.$sendall(iGridRef.$objs.Text.[iList.$line].$forecolor.$assign(pick(iList.Value,rgb(221,255,221),rgb(255,255,221),rgb(255,221,221))))
Calculate iList.$line as 0
Calculate iExceptionsSet as kTrue
